An interesting insight on the internal software issues that led to the faulty boeing 737 and the ensuing chaos which disrupted
the supply chain for boeing. This relates to the issue of offshoring in software engineering, a trend that is increasing in modern
times. While it certainly boosted the company's bottom line over the years, this controversy could have been easily avoided if 
Boeing did its software development in-house, according to the article. Failure between the offshore team and the project management
team could be mitigated with Agile methodologies that we are currently learning now. 

Through this incident, we can learn that no matter the methodologies that different companies follow, having an inhouse team may be
the most important factor in producing good and clean code.
